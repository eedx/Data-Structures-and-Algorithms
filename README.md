# Data Structures & Algorithms

In this course I learned data structures and algorithms by solving 100+ practice problems :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:. The course starts from learning python programming to learning data structures to learning basic algorithms and finally learning advanced algorithms like A*.

## Installation

### Anaconda :fire:

The Anaconda distribution is free to install and can be downloaded using:

[https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Based on your operating system, installation instructions are available online:

- [Installing on macOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
- [Installing on Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)
- [Installing on Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)

### Python 3 :snake:

Python 3 is required to run the files within this repository.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook jupyter_notebook.ipynb
```

or
```bash
jupyter notebook jupyter_notebook.ipynb
```

on any Jupyter Notebook.
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
